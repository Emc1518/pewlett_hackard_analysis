Summary:

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

There are 90,396 positions at Pewlett Hackard that will need to be filled. This accounts for approximately 30% of the company's employees.The majority of this number are senior staff and engineers. However, the company may not be required to fill exactly 90,396 positions as the nature of these positions may have changed since these employees were hired and some positions may be eliminated or changed. It would be helpful for the company to know which departments will face the largest exit of retiring employees.

Development and Production are the departments that will have the highest number of employees that are retirement-ready. This information will help Pewlett Hackard in recruiting new employees.


According to the analysis there are 1549 employees who can become mentors. For a company of over 300,000 employees, this will not be an adequate number of mentors. Pewlett Hackard must change the eligibility for the mentorship program so that more employees can qualify to become mentors to new hires or newly promoted employees. By expanding the birthdate criteria to include employee birthdates from 1962, the mentorship pool increases to 56,859. This will ensure that there is a better mentee to mentor ratio to make the change caused by the large exit of retirees easier for the company.
